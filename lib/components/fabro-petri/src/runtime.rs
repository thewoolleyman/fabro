//! The Petri runtime Fabro runs its workflows on, assembled the same way at
//! create time (for `Runtime::check`) and at execution.
//!
//! Built-in sandbox factories are installed for every runtime and connect
//! only when a scope is acquired.
//!
//! The pieces are Petri's own: [`Runtime::standard`] with the Fabro frontend
//! carrying the server's settings layer, the Attractor step kinds (the real
//! ones, or the simulated registry for a dry run), the model client as the
//! `PebbleClient` capability so Petri's admission pass pins every LLM node's
//! route, the Fabro home for the skills step, and, at execution, Fabro's run
//! tools as the `HostTools` capability when the run enables them. Nothing
//! here knows about a run's record: the store and the run options are added
//! by the caller.
