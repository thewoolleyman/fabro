//! Fabro's awaited extension points on a Petri run: the checkpoint commit,
//! its platform record, the artifacts a stage leaves behind, the run's diff,
//! and the run-level ends, wrapped around Petri's own hook service so
//! `[[run.hooks]]` keep running.
//!
//! [`FabroHooks`] implements Petri's `ExecutionHooks` and is installed with
//! `Runtime::hooks` by [`engine::run`](crate::engine::run). It holds the
//! hooks the runtime installed before it (Petri's local hook service behind
//! its adapter, which serves `[[run.hooks]]`) and forwards every point to
//! them, `run_finished` and `scope_released` included, the way Petri's
//! embedding host does. Its own work, at each point:
//!
//! - `prepare_result`: the checkpoint commit, before the `StepFinished` record
//!   is appended. Git-backed runs push that commit from the sandbox; a failed
//!   push warns and is retried at the next checkpoint and at final publication.
//!   A stage that failed on its own terms is committed like a successful one;
//!   only a cancelled attempt is not. A failed commit is fatal to the run: the
//!   outcome becomes a failure of class `checkpoint_failed`, the run is
//!   cancelled through the coordinator handle, and `transition` refuses the
//!   firing's routes, so no route is taken. The commit that creates the run
//!   branch also records where it started: the `run.branch` platform record
//!   (the branch name and the base commit) and the `git.identity` record (who
//!   authors the commits, and where that identity came from), both at that
//!   checkpoint's stage position, so the stream orders them with the firing's
//!   finish.
//! - `transition`: the platform checkpoint record, keyed on the Petri position
//!   and the checkpoint's operation identity, with the stage's diff from its
//!   parent commit (`diff_summary`, and the patch as a blob); then the stage's
//!   artifacts: every file under `[run.artifacts] include` in the stage's
//!   workspace goes to configured artifact storage and gets an
//!   `artifact.collected` record, unless the same file with the same content
//!   was already collected earlier in the run. A failed write is a recorded
//!   problem on the transition, never a blocked route.
//! - `finalize_run`, required for every run: the run's diff, its run branch
//!   against its base commit, as the `run.diff` platform record with the patch
//!   as a blob; a failed checkpoint, which fails the run and skips publication;
//!   for a successful run, its publication ([`RunPublisher`]: the platform
//!   pushes the run branch and opens a pull request), whose failure fails the
//!   run before its terminal record.
//! - `run_finished`: the forwarded point, so the local service runs
//!   `run_complete` and `run_failed` with the sandbox in place.
//! - `scope_acquired`: a fresh run's Git target checked out into the workspace
//!   from inside the scope ([`crate::source`]); a resumed run uses its
//!   surviving workspace, while an explicit fork fetches the source run's
//!   branch from GitHub. A checkout that fails fails the scope's firings with
//!   the reason.
//! - `scope_released`: forwarded, so the local service runs `sandbox_cleanup`
//!   with the sandbox in place. Fabro's own end-of-run work (the terminal
//!   lifecycle event, notifications on it) is the run lifecycle path's, on the
//!   worker's and server's side of the engine, and the workspace's retention is
//!   Petri's, `Retention::Always` for every Fabro setting
//!   ([`engine::RETENTION`](crate::engine::RETENTION)).
//!
//! # Operation identities
//!
//! Checkpoint and artifact effects are keyed on `(run key, execution,
//! DecisionId, effect kind)` from the hook context and deduplicated on retry:
//! the checkpoint's key is the attempt's decision in its execution, effect
//! `checkpoint`; an artifact's is the same decision, effect `artifact`, with
//! the file's path and content digest as the identity within it. A
//! re-dispatched attempt whose commit already landed reuses it when the
//! workspace still sits on it unchanged (see [`RunWorkspaces::commit`]); a
//! reissued routing decision finds the record, or the commit by its
//! trailers, and writes nothing twice; a file already collected under the
//! same path and digest is not collected again. Publication keeps the
//! publisher's reconciliation policy; required finalization adds no independent
//! effect ledger or guarantee of deduplication across every external crash.
//!
//! # Where the workspace is
//!
//! On the local provider the commit runs on the host, in the workspace
//! Petri's host backend keeps under the run directory (`crate::checkpoint`).
//! On Docker or Daytona the workspace lives inside the scope's sandbox: the
//! hooks keep the environment Petri hands them at `scope_acquired`, run
//! `git` inside the scope through it. Checkpoints, diffs, fetches and pushes
//! all use this environment. Only execution metadata, patches and selected
//! artifacts are persisted on the server. Normal resume requires the original
//! workspace; a fork acquires a new sandbox and fetches its checkpoint from
//! GitHub. A run with no GitHub source commits only when its workspace is on
//! the host (a local-folder, empty or dry run); its checkpoints stay in that
//! workspace. Docker and Daytona runs with no GitHub source record execution
//! checkpoints without Git commits.
