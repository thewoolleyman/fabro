//! A Fabro run executed by Petri: the one assembly the run's worker process
//! and the server share.
//!
//! The worker is where a Petri run executes, as a legacy run does: it
//! reaches the run's record through [`HttpRunStore`](crate::HttpRunStore)
//! with its token, and everything else here is the same as in the server.
//! The server itself executes a run only under its test override, over
//! [`SqliteRunStore`](crate::SqliteRunStore) in its own process. Both build
//! the runtime the same way the create handler built it for
//! `Runtime::check`, name the Fabro run id as the run key, and hand the run
//! to `execution::host`: [`Execution::Start`] runs the admitted graphs
//! through `run_configured`; [`Execution::Resume`] continues the run from
//! its records through `resume_configured`, with the same observers a start
//! installs, as the host's docs require. A run whose creation a crash cut
//! short (Petri's `HostError::NotStarted`: the key is stored, the root
//! invocation is not) starts again from its admitted graphs under the same
//! key, which Petri takes over. The outcome is then derived from
//! `inspect_run` over a read handle of the same store, so what the caller
//! reports is what the durable record says.
//!
//! A failed write to the run's store ends the run's lifetime, not the run:
//! Petri records nothing after it and returns `CoordinatorError::StoreFailed`,
//! and no firing fails for it. [`run`] returns [`RunError::StoreFailed`]
//! without reading the record back, and [`conclusion`] says
//! [`Conclusion::Interrupted`]: the caller records no end for the run, and
//! the run resumes from its records, as after a crash.
//!
//! What the caller supplies beyond the runtime: the interviewer its
//! questions go to ([`interview`](crate::interview) in the worker and the
//! server), the secret provider over the vault ([`secrets`](crate::secrets))
//! and the blob table ([`blobs`](crate::blobs)) when it has them, and a
//! [`HooksSpec`] for Fabro's own [`FabroHooks`], which wrap Petri's local
//! hook service: the checkpoint commit before every durable finish and its
//! platform record after every route, with a failed commit ending the run
//! as a `checkpoint_failed` failure. What the standalone runner's defaults
//! give the run: Petri's local hook service for `[[run.hooks]]`, no host
//! tools, and `Retention::Always` for every workspace (see [`RETENTION`]).
//! Cancellation rides the caller's token: when it fires, the root
//! invocation is cancelled politely and Petri records why. The run's other
//! controls (pause, unpause, steer) are the caller's [`RunControls`]: its
//! pause gate is installed over the run's hooks, it observes the run, and
//! it is wired to the coordinator with the interviewer, on a start and on
//! a resume alike, so a run that was paused resumes paused.
//!
//! A resume here is Petri's own: the run continues from its records, and
//! sandbox leases are reconciled by label. What a host workspace looks like
//! when it does is the server's business before it relaunches the worker
//! ([`recovery`](crate::recovery)); a Docker or Daytona workspace is brought
//! to its snapshot by Fabro's hooks when its scope is acquired, and a lease
//! whose sandbox is gone gets a fresh one to restore into.
//!
//! No stage or agent event is projected into Fabro's tables here; the
//! caller appends only the run lifecycle events Fabro's read side needs to
//! finish the run, from the [`Conclusion`] this module derives. The
//! projection over Petri's records is the read-side item that follows.
