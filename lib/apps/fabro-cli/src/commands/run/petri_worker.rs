//! A Petri run in the worker process.
//!
//! `fabro run __run-worker` executes its run here, over the worker services:
//! the authenticated client, the control channel the server pushes cancels
//! through, the signal handlers, the vault snapshot and the CLI catalog. The
//! engine assembly itself is `fabro_petri::engine`, shared with the server's
//! in-process test path, so the run gets the same runtime, options and
//! interviewer either way.
//!
//! The run's record is [`HttpRunStore`] over the worker's client, leased
//! for this launch: the worker mints one owner id at start, logs it, and
//! every lease the run takes over the API names it. Both modes load the
//! admitted graphs through the client's blob read: `--mode start` runs them;
//! `--mode resume` continues the run from its records, and starts it again
//! from the graphs when a crash cut its creation short. Either way the
//! worker records the lifecycle transitions Fabro's read side needs
//! (`starting`, `running`, then `succeeded` or `failed`) as platform
//! records through the client. A failed write to the run's store ends the
//! run's lifetime and not the run: the worker records no end for it and
//! exits with `EX_TEMPFAIL` (75, [`ExitClass::Interrupted`]), and the server
//! launches a worker to resume it, as after a crash.
//!
//! The server's controls arrive over the control channel and go to Petri
//! through [`PetriControls`]: cancel (and `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`) fires one
//! token, which cancels Petri's root invocation politely; an
//! `interview.answer` message reaches the control interviewer the run's
//! questions wait on (`fabro_petri::interview`), so a human gate answered
//! through the API continues; pause and unpause (and `SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2`)
//! hold and release admission through the run's [`RunControls`]; a steer
//! goes to the agent stage it names (`node@visit`, or the node name) or,
//! unnamed, to the run's one live agent stage, and is refused with a
//! `run.notice` record saying why when neither resolves; an interrupt
//! resolves its stage the same way and stops the stage's current model
//! turn, with the text of an `interrupt_then_steer` as the stage's next
//! input, and is refused with a `run.notice` (`no_live_turn`,
//! `no_such_stage`) when Petri refuses it. A steer or an interrupt that
//! carries a request id is acknowledged over the control channel with its
//! outcome, delivered or refused with the notice's code, so the server can
//! answer the caller in its own response. The
//! paused state is mirrored to Fabro's lifecycle: a `paused` lifecycle
//! record when admission is held and `unpaused` when it is released, so
//! the server's live status and the projection agree with Petri's own
//! `run.paused` and `run.unpaused` records. A resumed run that was paused when
//! its worker died comes back paused, and the mirror reports that too. The
//! pair controls have no Petri adapter yet and are ignored with a warning.
//! A control channel that is lost for good cancels the run the same
//! way, and the worker exits with that loss as its error once the run has
//! settled.
//!
//! Fabro's hooks ride the run with their platform records over the same
//! client: the checkpoint commit in the run's workspace, on the host or
//! inside its sandbox, before every durable finish, and its record after
//! every route.
//!
//! The runtime's settings layer is left empty here: the run's graphs were
//! lowered and admitted at create time with the server's layer, and nothing
//! lowers again at execution. The model client is built from the worker's
//! catalog and vault snapshot for the providers whose credentials resolve,
//! the same eligible set the legacy worker's LLM backend uses. The same
//! vault snapshot is the run's secret provider, the run's blobs go to the
//! server's blob table through the worker's client, and the Fabro home the
//! server named on the command line is the home the skills step reads.
//! Fabro's run tools go to every agent session of the run when the run's
//! settings enable them (`[run.agent] fabro_tools`) and the worker token
//! carries the `agent:run_tools` scope the server issues for such a run,
//! the same gate the legacy worker applies; they bind to the worker's
//! client and the run id, as the legacy worker binds them.
